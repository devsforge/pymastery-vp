## Grammar Rules

### Punctuation

- **Oxford Comma**: Use a comma before the conjunction in a list of three or more items (e.g., "x, y, and z").
- **Quotation Marks**: Use double quotes for direct speech and single quotes for indirect speech
  (e.g., "She said, 'Hello,' and I replied, 'Hi.'").
- **Periods**: Inside quotations (e.g., "This is a sentence.").
- **Colons**: Lowercase after unless the full sentence follows (e.g., "She said: 'Hello.'").

### Capitalization

- **Headings**: Use Title Case for H1 headings and Sentence case for H2 and lower.
- **Technical Terms**: Follow official casing (e.g., Python, JavaScript, HTML).
- **Acronyms**: Use all caps without periods (e.g., API, HTML, CSS).

### Numbers

- Spell out one through nine (e.g., one, two, three).
- Use numerals for numbers ten and above (e.g., 10, 20, 30).
- Use numerals for decimals and fractions (e.g., 0.5, 1/2).
- Use numerals for percentages (e.g., 50%, 75%).
- In technical contexts, always use numerals with units (e.g., 100 km, 25°C, 3 seconds).
- In prose, spelled-out numbers are acceptable (e.g., "wait three seconds").

### Voice

- **Preferred**: Active voice
- **Acceptable**: Passive voice appropriate for the technical writing context
- **Avoid**: First-person singular ("I")

### Tone

- Professional but approachable
- Clear and direct
- Encouraging

### Technical writing

- Define acronyms on first use
- Use consistent terminology
- Prefer concrete to abstract
- Include examples for complex concepts
