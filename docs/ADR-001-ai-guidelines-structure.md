## Context

This project requires AI agents to operate within defined boundaries — protecting human-authored course content while
enabling autonomous work on infrastructure, documentation, and tooling. We need a structure for storing and organizing
AI guidelines that is:

- Discoverable by AI agents
- Maintainable by humans
- Modular enough to evolve independently
- Clear in its hierarchy and purpose

## Decision Drivers

- AI agents need a single entry point to understand project rules
- Guidelines span multiple concerns (roles, style, documentation, CI/CD)
- Some guidelines change more frequently than others
- Machine-readable configuration aids tooling and automation
- Human readability remains essential for oversight

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Single AGENTS.md File

**Description**: All AI guidelines in one Markdown file at the repository root.

**Pros**:

- Simple, single file
- Common convention (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md)
- Easy to discover

**Cons**:

- Becomes unwieldy as guidelines grow
- Harder to maintain independent sections
- No machine-readable structure
- Merge conflicts likely with multiple contributors

### Option 2: YAML Config Only

**Description**: All guidelines are encoded in a single YAML configuration file.

**Pros**:

- Machine-readable
- Good for tooling integration
- Structured data

**Cons**:

- Prose guidelines don't fit well
- Poor readability for complex rules
- Difficult for humans to review

### Option 3: Modular Structure (Current)

**Description**: YAML config as index, separate Markdown files for each ruleset domain.

**Pros**:

- Separation of concerns
- Each ruleset evolves independently
- YAML provides machine-readable index
- Markdown provides human-readable detail
- Easier to review changes per domain

**Cons**:

- Requires navigation between files
- AI must understand the index structure
- Slightly higher complexity

### Option 4: Hybrid with Entry Point

**Description**: Add AGENTS.md at repo root as human-readable entry point,
pointing to `.ai/config.yaml` for full structure.

**Pros**:

- Discoverable entry point at repo root
- Maintains modular benefits
- Best of both worlds
- Clear for both humans and AI

**Cons**:

- Slight duplication of high-level information
- One more file to maintain

## Decision

The chosen option is **Option 4: Hybrid with Entry Point**.

**Rationale**:

1. `AGENTS.md` at repository root provides immediate discoverability for AI agents
2. The modular structure in `.ai/` provides clear separation of concerns
3. Each ruleset (terms, guidelines, style, documentation) can be updated independently
4. The YAML config serves as a machine-readable index
5. Minimal duplication — AGENTS.md contains summary and pointers, not full content

**Additional decisions**:

- CI/CD ruleset (`04-cicd-pipelines.md`) is **deferred** from active rulesets until CI/CD implementation
  becomes a priority. The file may be retained for reference but is not listed in `config.yaml`.
- A `version` field is added to `config.yaml` for tracking ruleset iterations.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Discoverable entry point at the repository root
- Clear organization of AI guidelines by domain
- Independent evolution of each ruleset
- Machine-readable index enables future tooling
- Reduced merge conflicts

### Negative

- Slight duplication of high-level information between AGENTS.md and config.yaml
- One additional file to maintain

### Neutral

- CI/CD guidelines can be reactivated when needed

## Implementation

1. Place `AGENTS.md` at repository root as the entry point for AI agents
2. Maintain `.ai/config.yaml` as the authoritative index
3. Store rulesets in `.ai/rulesets/` with numeric prefix for ordering
4. Store templates in `templates/` directory
5. Store ADRs and developer docs in `/docs/` (flat structure, no subdirectories)
6. Reference rulesets from config.yaml with relative paths
7. Version the ruleset collection via `version` field in config.yaml
8. Use file naming conventions to distinguish document types (e.g., `ADR-xxx-*` prefix)
