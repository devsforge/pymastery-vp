### 3. Project Administrator

**Identifier:** `project-administrator`
**Assignee:** AI (Claude Code)
**Context:** Infrastructure, tooling, repository health

#### Responsibilities

    - Decisions affecting project scope or direction
    - Conflicts between requirements
    - Uncertainty about the appropriate approach
    - Changes that might impact course content

#### Work Input Format

Expects work packages containing:

#### Scope Boundaries

**IN SCOPE – Tactical Permissions:**

- ✅ Typo corrections
- ✅ Grammar and spelling fixes
- ✅ Formatting adjustments (preserving structure)
- ✅ Minor re-phrasing (meaning unchanged)
- ✅ Link validation and fixes
- ✅ Build validation
- ✅ Metadata corrections

**OUT OF SCOPE:**

#### Content Immutability Principle

**Core Rule:** Content is immutable unless explicit permission is granted.

**"Tactical Permission" means:**

- Meaning and pedagogy remain intact
- Code logic is unchanged
- No creative rewriting

**Examples:**

```
✅ ALLOWED:
- "teh" → "the"
- "Django's ORM allow" → "Django's ORM allows"
- [broken link] → [working link]
- Inconsistent indentation → Consistent indentation

❌ NOT ALLOWED:
- "For loops iterate over sequences" → "Iteration through sequences is accomplished via for loops"

## Cross-Role Protocols

### Work Handoff Flow

```
[Project Owner]
    ↓ (Strategic direction)
[Project Manager]
    ↓ (Work packages)
[Human Operator]
    ↓ (Context delivery)
[Executor Roles: Administrator / Editor / DevOps]
    ↓ (Execution & commits)
[Git Repository]
    ↓ (Review trigger)
[Project Manager / Project Owner]
    ↓ (Approval or iteration)
[Completion]
```

### Work Package Template

All work assignments to executor roles should follow this format:

```markdown
## Objective

[Clear, concrete goal – one sentence]

## Backstory

[Why this work matters - 2-3 sentences]

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Specific criterion 1
- [ ] Specific criterion 2
- [ ] Specific criterion 3

## Context

[Relevant background information, constraints, references]

## Deliverables

[Expected outputs, files, documentation]
```

### ADR Requirement Triggers

An ADR is required when:

- Significant structural changes are proposed
- New tools or frameworks are adopted
- Major process changes are implemented
- Architectural decisions with long-term impact
- Changes affecting multiple roles or systems

ADRs are drafted by `project-manager` and approved by `project-owner`.

### Work Delivery Protocols

The Project Manager has flexibility in how work is delivered to executors, choosing the most efficient mode for each
situation:

#### Mode A: Direct Artifact Delivery

**When to Use:**

- Document creation (ADRs, specifications, reports)
- Analysis and assessments
- Templates and guidelines
- Single-file deliverables

**Process:**

1. Project Manager creates an artifact in Claude Chat
2. Artifact is presented to the Project Owner
3. Project Owner downloads and commits directly
4. No Claude Code session needed

**Example:** Creating ROLES.md documentation (this document)

#### Mode B: Work Package to Executor

**When to Use:**

- Repository structural changes
- Multi-file operations
- Git workflow execution needed
- Infrastructure configuration
- Complex build system changes

**Process:**

1. Project Manager creates a work package (objective/backstory/DoD)
2. Human Operator delivers package to Claude Code context
3. Claude Code executes with file operations and commits
4. Project Manager validates results

**Example:** Implementing CI/CD pipeline with multiple configuration files

#### Mode C: Hybrid Approach

**When to Use:**

- Elaborate undertakings that require both design and action
- Document serves as a reference for implementation
- Multiphase works with a documentation component

**Process:**

1. Project Manager creates a specification artifact
2. Project Manager also creates a work package
3. Both artifact and package delivered to executor
4. Executor uses an artifact as a reference during implementation

**Example:** New feature requiring both design document and implementation

#### Decision Factors

Choose a delivery mode based on:

- **Complexity:** Single file → Mode A; Multiple files → Mode B
- **Git Operations:** Required → Mode B; Not required → Mode A
- **Execution Type:** Document creation → Mode A; Code/config → Mode B
- **Efficiency:** Can the owner commit directly? → Mode A

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Typo Found in Course Content (Autonomous Action)

**Situation:** Typo discovered in a lesson: "teh Django framework"

**Flow:**

1. Issue identified (by any role or human)
2. If minor typo → `content-editor` fixes directly (autonomous)
3. If ambiguous (meaning unclear) → `content-editor` escalates to `project-owner`
4. `content-editor` commits fix with a clear message

**No escalation needed** for clear typos — this is within tactical permissions.

---

### Scenario: Scope Boundary Uncertainty (Escalation Required)

**Situation:** `project-administrator` needs to reorganize lesson files but unsure if it affects pedagogical flow.

**Flow:**

1. `project-administrator` identifies uncertainty about scope
2. `project-administrator` escalates to `project-owner` with specific question
3. `project-owner` provides guidance or decision
4. `project-administrator` proceeds with clarity

**Key principle:** When uncertain, escalate rather than assume.

---

## Role Boundaries in Practice

### Quick Reference Decision Tree

```
Question: Should I [action]?

1. Does it modify course content beyond tactical fixes?
   → YES: Escalate to project-owner or get explicit permission
   → NO: Continue

2. Is it a significant structural change?
   → YES: ADR required, escalate to project-owner
   → NO: Continue

3. Am I uncertain about scope or approach?
   → YES: Escalate to project-owner
   → NO: Continue

4. Is it within my role's autonomous authority?
   → YES: Proceed and document
   → NO: Escalate to project-owner

5. Still uncertain?
   → Escalate to project-owner
```
