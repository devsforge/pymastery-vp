# Ukrainian Translation Status

This directory contains Ukrainian translations of the course content.

## Current Status

**Stub structure** - Translation is planned future work.

The Ukrainian content structure has been created as part of WP-243B (MkDocs setup).
Full translation from `content/en/` to `content/uk/` is planned as future work.

## Contributing

To contribute translations:
1. Use `content/en/` as source
2. Refer to legacy translations in `src/_locales/uk/` for terminology
3. Follow the same directory structure as English content
4. Submit pull requests with translated content

## Translation Guidelines

- Maintain technical term consistency
- Keep code examples in English (with Ukrainian comments where helpful)
- Preserve formatting and structure
- Ensure links reference correct locale paths
