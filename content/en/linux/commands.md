# Commands

A computer\'s operation, no matter which operating system it is running, can be
loosely described in three steps:

1.  The computer waits for user input
2.  The user selects a command and enters it via keyboard or mouse
3.  The computer executes the command

In a Linux system, the shell displays a \"prompt\", meaning that commands can be
entered. This prompt usually consists of a user and host (computer) name, the
current directory, and a final character:

    user@host: /home/user >

## Command structure

A command is essentially a sequence of characters which ends with a press
of the **enter** key and is subsequently evaluated by the shell. Many commands
are vaguely inspired by the English language and form part of a dedicated
\"command language\". Commands in this language must follow certain rules,
a \"syntax\", for the shell to be able to interpret them.

To interpret a command line, the shell first tries to divide the line into
words. Just like in real life, words are separated by spaces. The first word
on a line is usually the actual command. All other words on the line are
parameters that explain what is wanted in more detail.

Parameters starting with a dash (`-`) are called **options**.
These are usually optional \-- the details depend on the command in question.
They are \"switches\" that allow certain aspects of the command to be switched
on or off. If you want to pass several options to a command, they can be
accumulated behind a single dash, i.e. the options sequence `-a -l -F`
corresponds to `-alF`. Many programs have more options that can be
conveniently mapped to single characters or support *long options* for
readability (frequently in addition to equivalent single-character options).
Long options most often start with two dashes and cannot be accumulated:
`--foo --bar --foobar`.

Parameters with no leading dash are called **arguments**. These are often the
names of files that the command should process.

The general command structure can be displayed as follows:

command

:   what to do?

options

:   how to do it?

arguments

:   what to do it with?

### Internal and external commands

In shells, there are essentially two kinds of commands:

-   **Internal commands**

    These commands are made available by the shell itself.
    The Bourne-again shell contains approximately 30 such commands,
    which can be executed very quickly. Some commands (such as `exit` or
    `cd`) alter the state of the shell itself and cannot be provided
    externally.

-   **External commands**

    The shell does not execute these commands by itself but launches executable
    files, which within the file system are found in directories like */bin* or
    */usr/bin*. As a user, you can provide your own programs, which the shell
    will execute like other external commands.

## What is the shell?

All kinds of definitions are available, ranging from the simple comparison that
\"the shell is the steering wheel of the car\", to the vague definition in the
Bash manual which says that \"bash is an sh-compatible command language
interpreter\", or an even more obscure expression, \"a shell manages the
interaction between the system and its users\".

A shell can best be compared with a way of talking to the computer, a language.
Most users do know that other language, the point-and-click language of the
desktop. But in that language the computer is leading the conversation, while
the user has the passive role of picking tasks from the ones presented. It is
very difficult for a programmer to include all options and possible uses of
a command in the GUI-format. Thus, GUIs are almost always less capable than
the command or commands that form the backend.

The shell, on the other hand, is an advanced way of communicating with the
system, because it allows for two-way conversation and talking initiative.
