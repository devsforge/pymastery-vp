This appendix will provide an overview of common BusyBox commands, along with
brief descriptions and usage examples.

The content in this section is currently a placeholder and will be expanded
in future revisions of the documentation. In the meantime, you can refer to
the built-in BusyBox help (`busybox --help`) or the upstream BusyBox manual
for detailed command reference.

Planned structure for this appendix:
  - Summary of BusyBox and its purpose
  - Frequently used commands and their options
  - Examples of typical BusyBox-based workflows
  - Links to additional resources and manuals
